		<p>There’s something about reading that you just cannot describe. It makes you forget about the troubles in your life and helps you transcend into a world that is very different from yours. For instance, Harry Potter fans across the globe would call Hogwarts their home, and probably know every nook and corner of it as if they’ve been there a zillion times. And they have - through pages. That’s what reading does to you.   </p>
